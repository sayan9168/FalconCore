# FalconCore

**FalconCore** is a brand-new, secure, AI-native programming language built from scratch.

## Vision
- Fully independent runtime & VM (no Python dependency)
- Own bytecode format
- Own Virtual Machine
- Built-in security (secure variables, zero-trust)
- Native network stack
- AI integration at the language level

## Current Status
- Bootstrapping phase
- Lexer & Parser in development (Rust)
- Goal 1: Run "Hello World" in FalconCore

## Examples (coming soon)
- [Hello World](examples/hello.falcon)
- More examples will be added as the language grows

## How to Build (future)
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/falconcore examples/hello.falcon
